# Creates Figure 2 (saved as .pdf file in your working directory) and funnel plots (see graphs window)
# The objects "prepostresults" contain the results from the Bayesian meta-analysis for depression and anxiety.

# The objects saved with names "prepostmetaregNAMEOFVARIABLE" are the JAGS results from meta-regression for depression and anxiety.

# Bayesian dose-response meta-analysis for Anxiety and Depression using study-specific coefficients 
# and fixed (common) effect between depression and anxiety. Creates the panels of Figure 3. 
##**************************************************************************************
# Note:
# The script runs 20,000 simulation for each of the four variables and will take a while to execute.
# The results in the article are based on 100,000 simulations; if you want to run 80,000 more simulations
# open the script and un-comment the commented lines. 

source("Script for dose-response.R")
# The script creates: 
# - the dose-response panels in figure 3 (saved as .pdf files in your working directory)
# - report about the estimated coefficients and heterogeneity parameters (saved as "beta and tau X.txt" files in your working directory)
# - the data to plot in the dose-effect figures (saved as .csv files in your working directory)
# - JAGS objects named XFEAD where X is the dose variable name (e.g. logDeathFEAD has the JAGS output from the 
# dose-response model with the log-cumulative number of deaths as dose variable)
